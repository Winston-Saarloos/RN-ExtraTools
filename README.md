# Overview

This was created so that I can port over the RR-Image-Browser from being built with Electron to instead be a hosted ReactJS app.  This allows anyone to access it and there will be no need for software installation.

Production URL: https://rn-extratools.com/

How to deploy to production (because I keep forgetting):
- npm run build
- netlify deploy (does preview)
- netlify deploy --prod (deploys live)
